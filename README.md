# CC Lab-2 — Event Service

Minimal sample FastAPI application with basic event registration and simple load tests using Locust.

## Project summary
- Small web app demonstrating user registration, event listing, registration, and checkout.
- Includes Locust scenarios for load testing (`locust/`).

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+ (tested)
- Install dependencies:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick start (development)

Start the FastAPI app with auto-reload:

```powershell
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000` and use the UI.

## Running load tests (Locust)

Run a specific Locust scenario file from the `locust/` folder:

```powershell
locust -f locust/events_locustfile.py
locust -f locust/myevents_locustfile.py
```

Then open the Locust web UI to start a test and view metrics.

## Endpoints (summary)
- `GET /register` — register page
- `POST /register` — create user (form)
- `GET /login` — login page
- `POST /login` — perform login (form)
- `GET /events` — list events (accepts `?user=`)
- `GET /register_event/{event_id}?user=` — register logged-in user for event
- `GET /my-events?user=` — show user's registrations
- `GET /checkout` — compute checkout total

## Notes on optimizations
- Removed artificial CPU-bound loops that simulated work (they were causing high latency).
- Added a short in-memory cache for `GET /events` (`EVENTS_CACHE`) to reduce DB reads under load.
- Added a per-user cache for `GET /my-events` (`MY_EVENTS_CACHE`) and invalidate on registration.
- Queries now select only needed columns to reduce DB and template overhead.

## Configuration
- `EVENTS_CACHE_TTL` and `MY_EVENTS_CACHE_TTL` are defined in `main.py` (default 5s). Adjust for freshness vs performance.
- DB file: `fest.db` (SQLite).
